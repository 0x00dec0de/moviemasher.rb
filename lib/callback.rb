# A Transfer object and element in Job#callbacks representing a remote request
# triggered at a particular stage in processing. 
#
# There are four types of #trigger events for callbacks - TriggerInitiate, 
# TriggerProgress, TriggerError and TriggerComplete. After Job#process is 
# called, all TriggerInitiate callbacks are requested. Then, every 
# #progress_seconds or so, each TriggerProgress callback is requested. If a 
# problem is encountered while downloading or rendering/uploading a *required* 
# Output then all TriggereError callbacks are requested. And finally, all 
# TriggerComplete callbacks are requested. 
#
# The request body is always a JSON payload built from #data by recursively 
# evaluating all its String values. When a value contains curly brace pairs, the 
# text they wrap is treated as a key path into a scope that contains the Job and 
# Callback being triggered. For instance, {job.destination.type} might evaluate 
# to 'http'. To reference an Array element use a zero-based index in the 
# key path, like {job.inputs.0.type} which might evaluate to 'audio'. 
# 
# 	Callback.create {
# 		:type => Transfer::TypeHttp,
# 		:trigger => TriggerError,           # request only if error encountered
# 		:host => 'example.com',             # http://example.com/cgi-bin/error.cgi?i=123
# 		:path => 'cgi-bin/error.cgi',
# 		:parameters => {:i => '{job.id}'},  # Scalar - Job#id
# 		:data => {                          # body of request, JSON formatted
# 			:log => '{job.log}',            # String - Job#log
# 			:error => '{job.error}',        # String - Job#error
# 			:progress => '{job.progress}'   # Hash - Job#progress
# 		}
