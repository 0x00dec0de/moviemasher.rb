module MovieMasher
# An element in Job#inputs representing media to be included in the mashup, 
# which is eventually rendered into each Output format and uploaded. Inputs are 
# generally combined together in the order they appear, though audio can be 
# mixed by specifying #start times. 
# 
# There are four types of inputs: TypeAudio, TypeImage and TypeVideo (the three 
# raw types) plus TypeMash, which allows a Mash to be included like normal 
# audio/video. Mashes can be generated in a web browser utilizing 
# {moviemasher.js}[https://github.com/moviemasher/moviemasher.js] or 
# {angular-moviemasher}[https://github.com/moviemasher/angular-moviemasher] 
# and can include raw elements composited on multiple tracks along with titling, 
# effects and transformations over time.
#
# Relevant keys depend on #type, though all inputs have #av, #source and #length 
# keys. After downloading, relevant inputs are probed and will have their 
# #duration set if it's not already. The #no_audio or #no_video keys might 
# change to, as well as #av which relies on them (for instance, from AV::Both to 
# AV::Video for a video that is found to contain no audio track). 
#
#   Input.create {
#   	:type => Input::TypeVideo,
#   	:source => 'video.mp4',
#   	:fill => 'crop',        # remove pixels outside output's aspect ratio
#   	:gain => 0.8,           # reduce volume by 20%
#   	:offset => 10,          # remove first ten seconds
#   	:length => 50,          # remove everything after the first minute 
#   }

# TypeMash can point to anything that responds with a JSON formatted mash. After 
# download they will pass the parsed Hash to Mash.new and reset their #source to 
# the returned instance. Alternatively, #source can be initially set to a 
# Hash/Mash so as to avoid download.
#
# String - A HTTP or HTTPS URL to element, converted to appropriate Source. 
# Hash - Can describe either a download request or, for TypeMash inputs, a JSON formatted Mash. The former is sent to Source.create while the later is sent to Mash.new. 
# Returns - A Source object or, for TypeMash inputs after downloading, a Mash object.
